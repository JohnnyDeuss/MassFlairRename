# PowersDateUpdater
Bot to automate the date changes for certain powers subreddits, e.g.
[/r/DawnPowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DawnPowers). The date is calculated
based on the previous in-game date, which is given in the sidebar.
It assumes the change from BCE to CE happens on the border of a
timespan (25-0 BCE and 1-25 CE) and that the date is given in the format
"Year: 1234-5678 BCE", with whitespace allowed between parts.
