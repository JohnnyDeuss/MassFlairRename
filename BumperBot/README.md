# Bumperbot
This bot reposts submissions and marks the old submission as NSFW. It marks it
as NSFW because [/r/starcitizen_trades](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starcitizen_trades/)
overrides the CSS for NSFW to act as a "post closed" marker. It then reflairs
the post in the same way as the original. Therefore, you need the ability to
flair your own posts.
