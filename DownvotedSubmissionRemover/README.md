# DownvotedSubmissionRemover
Remove submissions that have a low upvote ratio after they've been up for a
while. Only looks at the newest 1000 comments, so will not work on very active
subreddit (i.e. more than a 1000 submission within the delay time). This can not
remove submissions before their score becomes public, as Reddit hides a
submission's score for the first few hours, even to the API.
