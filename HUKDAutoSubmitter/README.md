## Installation instructions
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/JohnnyDeuss/reddit-bots). This
script needs to be scheduled. This script doesn't scrape HUKD, but uses its API,
so you'll have to get an API key first. You can get one by following the
instructions in the "Getting a Key" section [here](https://www.hotukdeals.com/rest-api/docs).
